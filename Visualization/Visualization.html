    <div class="Facts">
<p>Fact: PutBulls bite humans more commonly than any other breed.</p>
<p>Fact: PutBulls are the 81st most popular breed.</p>
<p>Fact: After the ATTP association worked to test for dog aggression by breed it was found that PitBulls were no more aggressive than the average breed.</p>
    </div>
<h4 class="paragraphCall">This information makes it clear than PitBulls are being abused at an allarming rate</h4>
    <div class="abuse">
<p>The PitBulls would not be biting humans so much if they were raised properly.</p>
<p>This likely points to high rates of dog fighting as the bites as so alarmingly high that simple neglect cannot be the cause.</p>
    </div>
<h4 class="finalParagraph">The abuse of PitBulls must be stopped</h4>
<p>Since PitBulls are not an aggressive dog breed by nature they must be raised properly, and with love.</p>
