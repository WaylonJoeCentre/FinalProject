<p>Source for popular dog breeds:
This source contains a list of dog breeds by popularity. I trust it because it comes from the American Kennel club. The AKC is a reliable source for information as it is an organization dedicated to dogs with no motivation for misinformation.

Dog Bite Data:
This source contains information on the total number of dog bites by breed and gender. I trust this information because it comes from the united states government. It was collected by the state government of New York.
